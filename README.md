**Abstract:**
This paper aims to determine the relationship between carbon emissions and firm performance in the ASEAN-5 region through a panel Generalized Least Squares (GLS) random and fixed effects model. Data was retrieved from the Eikon Refinitiv from 2019 to 2022 and is analyzed to identify its impact on Tobin’s Q and Free Cash Flow (FCF). While existing literature has attempted to examine the connection between the two, the inconclusive findings through the use of conventional measures of firm performance signified the uncertainty of ROE and ROA in the context of identifying the effects of carbon emissions; Thus, the study distinctively includes FCF as a measure of firm performance and presents carbon emissions and other variables in relative terms, divided by total revenue, to account for heterogeneity in firm size. According to the results, it appears that total carbon intensity does not significantly affect Tobin’s Q, suggesting that a firm’s market value will be unaffected even if it pursues decarbonization efforts. However, total and direct carbon emissions were found to decrease the FCF margins of firms. Thus, there is an incentive for firms to proceed with carbon reduction strategies. In line with this, governments in the ASEAN-5 region may consider imposing stricter carbon regulations on corporations in their respective countries to prompt investors to assign higher values to low-polluting firms in the stock market. Such regulations may also assist firms in making more prudent and environmentally friendly investments that will allow them to retain higher levels of FCF
